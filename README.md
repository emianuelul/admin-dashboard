Project to show what I learned from the Intermediate HTML & CSS course from The Odin Project. I used a little bit of everything I know, CSS variables, CSS Grid + Flex, styling form elements (the search input). The task was to make a site that looked similar to the image given.

This is what it's supposed to look like. I tried to stick to it as much as I could. I changed some stuff, mainly making stuff appear larger but it's mainly the same.
